# blackjack
Command line version of the card game "Black jack".
Run program and the command line will guide you through the game by having you
respond to prompts on the command line.

This program is an interactive blackjack game that you play from the command line. This was a final project for my Advanced Rust Workshop class. I have plans to add persistent
stats and have the file system half built but not implemented.
